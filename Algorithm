Take p & q . [ p&q is prime number]
For public key:  choose e where e is an integer  and is not a factor of n. again 1<e<Q(n).
For private key: Q(n)=(p-1)(q-1).
Find d where d is the inverse of (e mod Q(n))/[d=(e mod Q(n))^-1].
For encryption (p^e mod n) [p is the positional value of alphabet chart ].
For Decryption (p^d mod n) [ p is the positional value of alphabet chart]
